# Web Search Engine with Advanced Algorithms

Explore our Web Search Engine, a culmination of web scraping and sophisticated algorithms like PageRank, Betweenness Centrality, and Vector Space Model (VSM). This project, developed during the semester, presents an innovative approach to information retrieval and navigation.

## Project Highlights

- **In-depth Web Scraping:** Extensive data collection from the web forms the foundation of our search engine, ensuring a comprehensive and up-to-date database.

- **PageRank Algorithm:** Influence of Google's PageRank algorithm enhances search result relevance, prioritizing authoritative web pages.

- **Optimized Navigation:** Betweenness Centrality identifies optimal navigation routes by recognizing key nodes in the interconnected web.

- **Precision with VSM:** Vector Space Model accurately matches user queries with relevant documents, ensuring precise information retrieval.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute `web_search.py` to initiate the search engine.
4. Enter your queries to explore the vast online landscape.
